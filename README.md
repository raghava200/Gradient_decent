Gradient Descent Algorithm
Gradient Descent is a fundamental optimization algorithm used in machine learning and deep learning. It's used to minimize the cost function by iteratively moving in the direction of the steepest descent of the cost function. This iterative optimization process continues until convergence, where the algorithm finds the minimum of the cost function.

Key Concepts:
Cost Function: Represents the difference between predicted values and actual values.
Gradient: A vector of partial derivatives of the cost function with respect to each parameter.
Learning Rate: Determines the size of the steps taken during optimization.
Update Rule: The parameters are updated in the opposite direction of the gradient, scaled by the learning rate.
Steps of Gradient Descent:
Initialize parameters randomly or with some predefined values.
Calculate the gradient of the cost function with respect to each parameter.
Update the parameters by moving in the opposite direction of the gradient.
Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence or for a fixed number of iterations.
Types of Gradient Descent:
Batch Gradient Descent: Computes the gradient using the entire dataset.
Stochastic Gradient Descent: Computes the gradient using a single randomly chosen data point.
Mini-batch Gradient Descent: Computes the gradient using a small random subset of the dataset.
Benefits:
Versatility: Can be applied to various optimization problems.
Efficiency: Suitable for large datasets and high-dimensional parameter spaces.
Flexibility: Various modifications and extensions exist to improve performance and address specific challenges.
